This is a compiler that translates a toy source language into a toy machine language.

Examples of the source language can be found [here](A5/tests/passing/fib.488) and [here](A5/tests/passing/A1c.488) -- it's sort of like [Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_(programming_language)). See [`handouts/`](handouts) for more details.

The target language is a simple stack machine described [here](handouts/machine.pdf) -- basically a stripped-down version of [JVM bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode).

The final version of the compiler is in [`A5/`](A5/).
