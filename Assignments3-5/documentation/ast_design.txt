The hierarchy of the classes were mainly left the same as they were originally.
We added a couple of fields to the AST class so that we could record the line and column numbers
since this information was going to be used later during the semantic analysis.

We added an iterator for the ASTList since we were going to need to iterate the elements of this list
also during the semantic analysis.

We also made some changes to the way that Indentable nodes were printed by the feature so that
when the AST is printed we would be able to recreate the source code as closely as possible.
For testing purposes we also create a script called ast_view_diffs which outputs a folder tmp where
the user can observe the difference between the source file and the string version of the AST. This allows
to visually confirm the structure of the AST.
