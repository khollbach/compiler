CSC488 Assignment 1

Each group member did the following part:
George: (a) Using a 'test' procedure, the program ensures that Boolean expressions crafted using each of the 488 language's operators all evaulate to 'true', and reports whether each test passes or fails. Tests are categorized by the type of operator being tested (i.e. Boolean, Comparison, Arithmetic).
Arturo: (b) The program declares 4 Integer arrays and assigns values to the indices that are valid for each array. Finally, the program tests that all arrays have the right values assigned to their indices.
Kevan:  (c) The program tests a number of different ways of constructing loops. The examples are intended to cover as many corner-cases as possible and exercise all loop-related features available in 488lang.
Tarang: (d) The two functions perform arithmetic and logical operations on the global variables and return the result. The two procedures modify the global variables, and do not return anything.
Andrew: (e) The program consists of 2 recursive functions, 2 recursive procedures and 1 nested recursive function.
