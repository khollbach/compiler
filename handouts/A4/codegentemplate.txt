1. Storage
a) Variables are allocated in a new stack frame. The constant they refer to is stored at the top of memory (at address memorySize-1). 
b) As function/procedure calls are made, stack frames are created with instances of the required variables.
c) 
d) All boolean variables point to either the 'true' or 'false' boolean constants, which are stored at the top of memory. Integer constants can be created as required. 
e) Text constants can also be created as required, stored in the top of memory.

2. Expressions

3. Functions and Procedures

4. Statements

5. Everything Else
